# deeplearning_cancer

This is an ongoing project for machine learning course at TAMU.

Big picture: Analyze cancer data from ~30 different tissue types to learn tissue specific and global genomics patterns that causes cancer.

Challenges: Obtain comparable data from various biomedical resources, computational challenges due to large volume of data, validation and biological interpretation of results.

Proposal: Run baseline models and deep learning models to identify inherent functional relationships between genome coordinates and tissue specific cancer.
